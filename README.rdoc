= Hoe Loves Mercurial

* http://bitbucket.org/mml/hoe-hg

== Description

A set of Hoe plugins for tighter Mercurial integration. Provides tasks to
automate release tagging and pushing and changelog generation. I
expect it'll learn a few more tricks in the future.

== Examples

    # in your Rakefile
    Hoe.plugin :hg

If this plugin doesn't see a .hg directory at the root of your
project, it'll silently deactivate itself.

=== Autogenerating the Changelog

    $ rake hg:changelog

This takes all the commit messages since your last release and formats
'em into a nice RDoc fragment. If you specify <tt>VERSION</tt>, it'll
be used in the changelog fragment. If you specify <tt>FROM</tt>, it'll
be used as a starting point for the changelog instead of your last
release.

Commits that weren't made by a project developer will be attributed,
like this:

    * Did a thing with the stuff. [I R Contributor]

=== Generating the Manifest

    $ rake hg:manifest

This will regenerate <tt>Manifest.txt</tt> using <tt>hg
ls-files</tt>. It respects Hoe's manifest sort order and excludes.

=== Tagging and Sanity Checking a Release

    $ rake release VERSION=1.0.0

In addition to the normal RubyForge release process, this will create
and push a <tt>v1.0.0</tt> tag. It'll also abort the release if your
index is dirty, or if there are untracked files present.

== Dependencies

Hoe and Mercurial, obviously. I wouldn't be surprised if things don't quite
work for ancient hg  versions < 1.4.1

== Installation

    $ gem install hoe-git

== TODO

* Release tags are sorted lexicographically right now, which won't
  work for long.
