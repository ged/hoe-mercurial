= (Another) Mercurial Plugin for hoe

* http://bitbucket.org/ged/hoe-mercurial


== Description

This is my fork of the 'hoe-hg' plugin. I forked it because I use 
quite a few additional Mercurial tasks for my development workflow 
than are provided by the original, and I thought they'd possibly 
be useful to someone else.


== Examples

    # in your Rakefile
    Hoe.plugin :mercurial

If there isn't a '.hg' directory at the root of your project, it won't 
be activated.


=== Committing

    $ rake hg:checkin

    -or-

    $ rake ci

This will offer to pull and merge from the default repo (if there is one), 
check for any unregistered files and offer to add/ignore/delete or 
temporarily skip them, run the :precheckin task (which you can use to
run tests, lint, or whatever before checking in), builds a commit message
file out of the diff that's being committed and invokes your editor on it, 
does the checkin, then offers to push back to the default repo.

=== Pre-Release Hook

This plugin also hooks Hoe's 'prerelease' task to tag and (optionally) sign 
the rev being released, then push to the default repo. If there are any 
uncommitted files, it also verifies that you want to release with 
uncommitted changes, and ensures you've bumped the version number by 
checking for an existing tag with the same version.

=== Other Tasks

It also provides other tasks for pulling, updating, pushing, etc. These
aren't very useful on their own, as it's usually just as easy to do the
same thing yourself with 'hg', but they're intended to be used as 
dependencies in other tasks. 


== Dependencies

Hoe and Mercurial, obviously. I wouldn't be surprised if things don't quite
work for ancient hg  versions < 1.4.1


== Installation

    $ gem install hoe-hg
